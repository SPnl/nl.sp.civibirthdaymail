* Civi Birthday

This CiviCRM extension sends an email to ROOD members who turned 16, to attend them to the fact
that they can now be SP members too.


Sends a birthday mail to members that turned a specific age the day the script runs.

** Requirements

- CiviCRM Mail API (Robin's fork, because he fixed a token related bug): https://github.com/SPnl/org.civicoop.emailapi
- Tested on CiviCRM 4.6

** Installing

1. Don't forget to install the CiviCRM Mail API Fork: https://github.com/SPnl/org.civicoop.emailapi
2. Install the extension
3. Add the API method: Contact.Sendroodbirthdaymail as a daily task.

BE SURE TO RUN THIS AS DAILY TASK AND NOT HOURLY. Otherwise contacts will get multiple mails a day on their birthday.

** Todo

- Installing when CiviRules is not installed gives a DB error, this should be a conditional check
