* ROOD Civi Birthday

This CiviCRM extension sends an email to ROOD members who turned 16, to attend them to the fact
that they can now be SP members too.


Sends a birthday mail to ROOD members that turned 16 the day the script runs.

** Requirements

- CiviCRM Mail API (Robin's fork, because he fixed a token related bug): https://github.com/SPnl/org.civicoop.emailapi
- Just clone it in the CiviCRM extensions directory
- Tested on CiviCRM 4.6

** Todo

- Installing when CiviRules is not installed gives a DB error, this should be a conditional check
- There is currently no easy ROOD -> ROOD and SP membership link
