* Civi Birthday

This CiviCRM extension sends an email to contacts on their birthday.

Sends a birthday mail to members that turned a specific age the day the script runs.

** Requirements

- CiviCRM Mail API (Robin's fork, because he fixed a token related bug): https://github.com/SPnl/org.civicoop.emailapi
- Tested on CiviCRM 4.6

** Installing

1. Don't forget to install the CiviCRM Mail API Fork: https://github.com/SPnl/org.civicoop.emailapi
2. Install the extension
3. Add the API method: Contact.Sendbirthdaymail as a daily task and fill in the correct arguments.

BE SURE TO RUN THIS AS DAILY TASK AND NOT HOURLY. Otherwise contacts will get multiple mails a day on their birthday.
